# CameraCalibration
OpenCV Camera calibration, distortion, perspective correction - mask, video overlay

The video.py file contains the main code for the camera calibration
and the video overlay, in the camera.py file there is a code to 
take pictures with your webcam, since the calibration has to be done 
from the camera that you are going to use, the images you send may 
serve as a reference, but these images will not help to calibrate 
your camera.
